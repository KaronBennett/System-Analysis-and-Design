# System-Analysis-and-Design
This is for my System Design and Analysis course.  This is Project One and Two, which consists of documentation of business requirements and system design for a fictional company called "DriverPass".

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project was created for a client who wanted a system to help students prepare for their driving exams. The client needed a web-based application that allowed users to register, schedule lessons, access online practice tests, and track their progress. The system also needed administrative features for managing users, lessons, and instructor schedules.

What did you do particularly well?

I did particularly well in creating clear and organized UML diagrams that outlined how users and the system interact. My use case and activity diagrams effectively represented the major system functions and user actions, helping to visualize how different parts of the system connect.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise my sequencing diagrams. I struggled with knowing which arrows and shapes to use, and that made them harder to read. If I could go back, I’d review UML standards more carefully and make sure my arrows and lifelines clearly show the order of events. That would make the diagrams much easier to follow and more professional-looking.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the user’s needs by analyzing the client’s request for features like lesson scheduling, progress tracking, and online test access. I translated those needs into system components that supported easy navigation and clear workflows. Considering user needs is crucial because it ensures the system is intuitive, efficient, and aligns with real-world use, which ultimately improves user satisfaction and system success.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I approach software design iteratively by first identifying the main users and their goals, then breaking those goals into smaller use cases. I use UML diagrams to visualize the system’s structure and behavior. In the future, I would use more user feedback and prototyping early in the process to refine the design before development begins.
